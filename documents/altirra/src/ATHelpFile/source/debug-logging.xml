  <p>
    The simulation has a number of optional logging channels which can report additional
    information about what is going on in the emulated program. The debugger has commands
    to manage the logging configuration.
  </p>
  <h2>Displaying logging channels</h2>
  <p>
    The <tt>lfl</tt> (log filter list) command displays the list of available logging
    channels and their current status:
  </p>
  <pre class="example">Altirra> lfl
850         off  850 interface SIO activity
CAS         on   Cassette I/O
CASDATA     off  Cassette data
CASDRDATA   off  Cassette direct data
CASIMAGE    off  Cassette image processing
CS8900AD    off  CS8900A network data (requirse CS8900AN channel)
CS8900AN    on   CS8900A network transmit/receive
CS8900AR    off  CS8900A reads
CS8900AW    on   CS8900A writes
DISK        off  Disk activity
DISKCMD     off  Disk commands
DISKIMAGE   off  Disk image load details
DISKXFR     off  Disk data transfer
DS1305CR    off  DS1305 real time clock reads
DS1305UR    off  DS1305 real time clock user reads
DS1305W     off  DS1305 real time clock writes
FLASH       off  Flash memory erase operations
FLASHWR     off  Flash memory write operations
FPACCEL     off  Floating-point acceleration
HOOKSIO     off  OS SIO hook messages
HOOKSIOREQS  off  OS SIO hook requests
IDE         off  IDE activity
IDEERROR    off  IDE interface errors
MODEM       off  Modem activity
MODEMDATA   off  Modem interface data
MODEMTCP    off  Modem TCP/IP activity
PCLINK      off  PCLink activity
V3021       off  V3021 real time clock accesses
VDISK       off  Virtual disk activity
XEPCMD      off  XEP-80 Commands
XEPDATA     off  XEP-80 Data Transfer</pre>
  <p>
    Most channels default to off, although a few are enabled by default. The <tt>lfe</tt>
    (log filter enable), <tt>lfd</tt> (log filter disable), and <tt>lft</tt> (log filter
    enable tagged) commands are used to modify the state of a channel. For example, enabling
    the <tt>MODEM</tt> channel is useful for checking the modem commands being sent out
    over the R: device:
  </p>
  <pre class="example">Altirra> lfe modem
Enabled logging channel: MODEM
Altirra> g
MODEM: Executing command: [Z]
MODEM: Sending response: OK</pre>
  <h2>Additional logging paths</h2>
  <p>
    There are a couple of other useful logging paths that are not controlled via the logging
    system:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt>.traceser</tt> enables logging of raw serial I/O bus traffic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>.tracecio</tt> enables logging of CIO commands.
    </li>
  </ul>
