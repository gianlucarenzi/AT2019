  <p>
    The Speedy 1050 is a modified Atari 1050 with support for single, enhanced, and double
    density disks.

  <h2>NTSC compatibility</h2>
  <p>
    The Speedy 1050 cannot reliably handle high speed writes with an NTSC computer and
    will constantly trigger SIO device NAK errors (error 139). This happens because NTSC
    computers send data slightly faster than PAL computers and the Speedy 1050 firmware's
    receive loop is slightly too slow to handle the faster NTSC speed. Firmware versions
    up through 1.6 have this problem; a fixed 1.7 version is available for the MegaSpeedy
    add-on, which includes Speedy 1050 as one of its modes.
