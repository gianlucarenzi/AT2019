    Cartridge-based devices plug into the cartridge port of the Atari computer.
  </p>
  <h2>Devices</h2>
  <p>
    The following cartridge-based devices are emulated by Altirra:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="dragoncart.html">DragonCart</a></li>
    <li><a href="myide.html">MyIDE</a></li>
    <li><a href="devices-rtime8.html">R-Time 8</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conflicts</h2>
  <p>
    Since these devices use the cartridge port, they can conflict with other devices that also use
    the same port. Typically, only one cartridge can be plugged in at a time. However, a few cartridges,
    notably the SpartaDOS X cartridge, have a pass-through expansion port that allows a secondary cartridge to
    be plugged. Altirra supports cartridge stacks, but like on real hardware, the pass-through port
    can interfere with the secondary cartridge's operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In rare cases, it is possible to set up an impossible configuration in emulation
    with two cartridge-based devices simultaneously active. This most often occurs when two emulated
    devices are activated when neither has a pass-through port. On a real computer, this would be noticed
    because the only way to get two such devices into the cartridge port at the same time would be
    with a hammer; in emulation this can result in bizarre and broken behavior.
