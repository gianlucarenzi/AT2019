    Altirra has a number of options that can be used to customize the emulated Atari hardware.
  </p>
  <toc/>
  
  <h2>Disk options</h2>
  <h3>Accurate sector timing</h3>
  <p>
    Causes the emulator to simulate rotational delays caused by sector position and seek delays (step and head settling time).
    This results in a slower disk load, but is sometimes necessary to load protected disks.
  </p>
  <p>
    When disabled or when the SIO patch is enabled, Altirra still attempts to track disk rotation for protected disks. This means
    that CPU timing is not preserved, but rotational position is still noted.
  </p>
  <h3>Show sector counter</h3>
  <p>Displays the current sector being read or written instead of the unit number in the on-screen indicator.</p>
  <h2>Cassette options</h2>
  <h3>Auto-boot on startup</h3>
  <p>
    Automatically holds down START during system startup and then hits a key to initiate a cassette tape load. This only works
    with cassette tapes that have a machine language program; BASIC tapes must be loaded via CLOAD at the BASIC prompt instead.
  </p>
  <h3>Load data as audio</h3>
  <p>Converts the data from a .CAS tape image into raw audio data so it plays through the speaker.</p>
  
  <h2>Misc options</h2>
  <h3>Warp speed</h3>
  <p>Disables the speed limiter and audio sync, and runs the emulator as fast as possible.</p>
  <h3>Pause when inactive</h3>
  <p>
    When set, causes Altirra to pause emulation when its window goes inactive. Use this to prevent the emulated Atari from using
    CPU time when in the background.
