<topic title="R-Time 8">
  <p>
    The R-Time 8 cartridge allows the computer to keep track of accurate time. It
    contains a small battery backed up real-time clock (RTC) chip.
  </p>
  <h2>Using the R-Time 8</h2>
  <p>
    The intended use for the R-Time 8 is to boot a DOS that keeps track of file
    timestamps and load a driver to sync its clock with the one on the R-Time 8.
    Typically this is either disk-based SpartaDOS or the cartridge-based
    SpartaDOS X. In the latter case, the R-Time 8 is plugged into the pass-through
    port on the SDX cartridge instead of directly into the computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The R-Time 8 can also be read using a special <tt>Z:</tt> CIO device.
    The device driver for this handler must be loaded from disk and is not included
    with the emulator.
  </p>
  <h3>Emulated behavior</h3>
  <p>
    In Altirra, the R-Time 8 always reads the true date and time in the local
    time zone. Any attempts to
    change the date or time on the real-time clock chip are discarded. Also, the
    alarm functionality is not currently implemented.
