	<p>
		The Atari XF551 disk drive supports single-density (90K), enhanced density (130K),
		double density (180K), and double-sided double density (360K) disks.
	</p>
	<h2>Density switching issue</h2>
	<p>
		The real XF551 running on stock firmware has problems switching from single-density
		or enhanced-density to double-density modes, which is emulated faithfully if the
		same firmware is used. The symptom is that inserting a double-density disk after
		reading or booting either a single-density or enhanced-density disks times out
		with a read error after a significant delay. This is caused by the firmware failing
		to recognize the double-density disk and trying to read track 13, sector 22
		when DOS requests a read of the first directory sector.
	</p>
	<p>
		Booting off of a double-density disk avoids this problem because the firmware
		successfully switches to double-density when DOS.SYS is read during the boot process.
		Enhanced DOSes that allow direct control of the density setting for a drive will
		work around this, as well, XF551-specific DOSes that read sector 4 to trigger
		a density switch on the drive.
