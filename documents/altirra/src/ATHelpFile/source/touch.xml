<topic title="Touch support">
  <p>
    Altirra is primarily meant for use with keyboard, mouse, and game controller devices. However, it
    does have some support for touch input.
  </p>
  <h2>Pointer-based controller input</h2>
  <p>
    By default, the main display window operates with standard touch input support in Windows, such
    that the press-and-hold gesture activates the simulated right mouse button. This activates the copy/paste
    context menu. However, if an input controller is set up with bindings to the left mouse button, and
    not the right mouse button, this gesture is automatically disabled. This improves responsiveness
    by allowing touch presses to immediately be detected and passed to emulation instead of incurring
    the usual delays.
  </p>
  <h2>On-screen keyboard</h2>
  <p>
    The on-screen keyboard that is available via the game controller can also be activated by touch
    by swiping up from the bottom portion of the display window. This UI also modifies the gesture
    settings so that touching the display immediately presses down keys on the on-screen keyboard.
    Touching elsewhere on the display closes the on-screen keyboard.
