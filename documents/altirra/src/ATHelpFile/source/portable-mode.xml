    Altirra can be run in <i>portable mode</i> to ease transport of working setup between host machines.
    In portable mode, Altirra stores settings in an .ini file instead of in the Windows Registry, allowing
    both the emulator and the emulator configuration to be placed on a removable storage device.
  </p>
  <p>
    To switch to portable mode, either start Altirra with the <tt>/portable</tt> switch, or create
    <tt>Altirra.ini</tt> directly. Altirra automatically switches to portable mode whenever the INI file
    is present, so once this file is created, there is no need to continue specifying <tt>/portable.</tt>
  </p>
  <h2>Limitations of portable mode</h2>
  <p>
    For the most part, portable mode acts substantially the same as the regular Registry-based mode.
    However, there are slight differences in some corner cases. The main difference is that if multiple
    instances of Altirra are started and exited at the same time, they may hit a locking conflict on
    the <tt>Altirra.ini</tt> file, resulting in one of the instances being unable to load or save settings.
    A warning will be displayed on startup if the emulator is unable to load settings in portable mode.
    Launching multiple copies in portable mode that frequently is a rare corner case, but it can be easily
    worked around by using multiple installations of Altirra, each with their own INI file.
