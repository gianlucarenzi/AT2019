<topic title="Serial bus based devices">
  <p>
    Serial I/O (SIO) bus based devices plug into the trapezoidal SIO port on the computer. The SIO bus has lower speed than
    an internal or cartridge-based interface, but supports a wider variety of devices. Multiple devices can be connected to the serial bus by daisy-chaining.

  <h2>Devices</h2>
  <p>
    The following serial bus based devices are emulated by Altirra:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Cassette tape drives
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="devices-cassette.html">410/1010 Program Recorder</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <a href="disk.html">Disk drives</a>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>810 Disk Drive</li>
      <li>1050 Disk Drive</li>
      <li>XF551 Disk Drive</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Serial port interfaces
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="serial.html">850 Interface Module</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Other devices
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="pclink.html">PCLink</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conflicts</h2>
  <p>
    Because the SIO bus allows for daisy chaining, conflicts on the SIO bus are rare. Some devices, like the 410 Program Recorder,
    don't have a daisy chaining port and must be at the end of the chain on real hardware; Altirra allows more than one
    such device to be attached, but this doesn't pose a problem in emulation.
