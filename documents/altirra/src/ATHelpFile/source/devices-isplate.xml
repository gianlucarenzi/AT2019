<topic title="I.S. Plate">
  <p>
    The I.S. Plate is a modified Atari 1050 with support for single, enhanced, and double
    density disks.

  <h2>Accurate sector timing</h2>
  <p>
    The "accurate sector timing" option is forced on when emulating I.S. Plate drives. This
    is to work around a bug in the ISP firmware where the firmware crashes and reboots if it
    sees more than about 100 sectors within a quarter of a second.

  <h2>NTSC compatibility</h2>
  <p>
    The US/IS Doubler emulation option in the ISP Lightspeed rev. 2.0 software will not work
    if the computer is set to NTSC. This is due to out of tolerance
    serial timing in the IS Doubler firmware preventing the computer from being able to
    receive. The timing is just barely within POKEY's requirements
    for an ideal PAL machine, but beyond what POKEY can receive for ideal NTSC. Your mileage
    may vary on real hardware due to real-world clock variance.
