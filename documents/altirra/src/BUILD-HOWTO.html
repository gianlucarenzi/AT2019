		<h1>Altirra Build Instructions</h1>
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<h3>Build machine</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Required: Windows 7 x64 or newer</li>
			<li>Recommended: Windows 10 x64</li>
			<li>Not supported: Windows XP or Vista (cannot run toolchain)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Building from an x86 system should
			work but is not tested or recommended, particularly since the x64 build
			cannot be tested on such a system.
		</p>
		<h3>Compiler</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Recommended: Visual Studio 2017 version 15.9.12 (Professional or Community)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Required feature: Windows XP support for C++</li>
				<li>Required features for ARM64: Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17763.0), Visual C++ compilers and libraries for ARM64</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Not supported: VS2015 or earlier</li>
			<li>Not supported: MinGW, GCC, Clang, Clang/C2</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Visual C++ Express for Desktop can probably be used with a couple of caveats. The Windows SDK
			is required for the Win32/COM build environment and the resource editor is
			not available. Note that this is not a tested configuration and Community or Professional
            Edition is recommended instead.
		</p>
        <p>
            The GCC/MinGW and Clang compilers are not currently supported and will not work. As of this writing, the
            latest preview version of Clang/C2 (July 2016) will not work either.
        </p>
		<h3>DirectX SDK</h3>
		<p>
            As of 2.90, the DirectX SDK is no longer necessary for the build as D3DCompiler from the Windows SDK is used
            instead. However, since D3DCompiler no longer supports shader model 1.x, the remaining
            vs/ps1.1 shaders have been included in precompiled form. The source has been included and
            they can be rebuilt with the included <tt>rebuildps11.cmd</tt> script, but doing so requires
            an older version of the DirectX SDK that still has <tt>psa.exe</tt>, since the latest SDK
            only includes <tt>fxc</tt> which can only compile HLSL.
        </p>
        <p>

            only includes <tt>fxc</tt> which can only compile HLSL.
		</p>
        <p>
            If you really, really feel the need to edit the pixel shaders and don't want to install
            DXSDK November 2008 to get psa.exe, you can write a small wrapper around D3DXAssembleShader().
            Sorry, but at this point even the author's tolerance for ps1.x is waning.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have the DirectX SDK in your default VC++ Directories setup, make sure that its include
            headers are lower priority than the Windows SDK per Microsoft's integration guidelines. Otherwise,
            you can get compile warnings or errors due to it overriding newer DXGI headers from the Windows
            SDK.
        </p>
		<h3>Additional Tools</h3>
		<p>
			YASM 1.3.0 is needed for x86/x64 assembly language modules. (<a href="http://yasm.tortall.net/">http://yasm.tortall.net/</a>)
		</p>
		<p>
			MADS 1.9.8 is needed for 6502 assembly language modules. (<a href="http://mads.atari8.info/">http://mads.atari8.info/</a>)
		</p>
		<p>
			Newer versions of these tools should work but have not been tested. Older versions should be avoided;
            some older versions of MADS, for instance, will either fail to build the AltirraOS kernel or will
            introduce subtle corruption into floating point constants in the math pack.
		</p>
		<p>
			The HTML Help 1.4 toolkit is required to build the help file. It should be automatically installed
            with recent versions of Visual Studio. If not, it is available as a separate download from Microsoft.
		</p>
		<h2>Build environment setup</h2>
		<h3>Build location</h3>
		<p>
			Altirra is designed to build in arbitrary locations, but don't
			attempt to build it under a path that has spaces. This hasn't been tested and
			may fail if some paths are not quoted. Attempting to do so is simply asking for
			unnecessary trouble.
		</p>
		<h3>Local configuration</h3>
		<p>
			The build system is configured by a tree of property sheets and as of 2.90 supports
			configuration overrides that can be set without changing the base source files. This
			permits local configuration without having to alter files within source code control.
			All overrides are placed in the <tt>localconfig/active</tt> folder, with examples
			that can be copied from the <tt>localconfig/example</tt> folder. Note that the
			overrides are applied on top of instead of replacing the standard .props files.
		</p>
		<p>
			When using source code control, you may find it convenient to put <tt>localconfig/active/*</tt>
			in the "ignore" configuration file of your VCS so it will not pick up files in that
			folder for submission.
		</p>
		<h3>Platform setup</h3>
        <p>
            The <tt>PlatformSetup.props</tt> file controls the platform toolset that is used to build the
            programs. This allows the toolchain for the entire solution to be switched with one property sheet.
            The normal Visual Studio dialog to offering to upgrade the projects to the newest
            compiler has been inhibited to prevent the converter from breaking this setup. If you still
            receive this dialog, <b>do not upgrade the projects through it.</b> This will break the
            toolchain switching setup in the projects. The <tt>PlatformSetup.props</tt> file should be
            used to control the toolchain instead.
        </p>
		<p>
			To switch the toolchain locally, create <tt>localconfig/active/PlatformSetup.local.props</tt>
			and modify the toolchain setting in it. Use <tt>localconfig/example/PlatformSetup.local.props</tt>
			as a reference.
		</p>
		<p>
			The build initially comes set to use the VS2015 compiler with XP targeting enabled
			(<tt>v140_xp</tt>).To use the VS2015 compiler without XP targeting, edit <tt>PlatformSetup.props</tt>
			or <tt>PlatformSetup.local.props</tt>
            to select <tt>v140</tt> instead. This is necessary for Code Analysis. Note that
			Visual Studio should be restarted after editing any .props file manually as the IDE
			does not reliably recognize external changes to property files.
		</p>
		<h3>MADS Assembler</h3>
		<p>
			By default, the build process will attempt to source <tt>mads.exe</tt> from PATH.
			This can be overridden in the <tt>ATMadsPath</tt> property of <tt>localconfig/active/Altirra.local.props</tt>.
			Use <tt>localconfig/example/Altirra.local.props</tt> as a reference.
		</p>
		<h3>YASM Assembler</h3>
		<p>
			By default, the build process will attempt to source <tt>yasm.exe</tt> from PATH.
			This can be overridden in the <tt>YASMPath</tt> property of <tt>localconfig/active/YASM.local.props</tt>.
			Use <tt>localconfig/example/YASM.local.props</tt> as a reference.
		</p>
		<h2>Building</h2>
		<h3>First time</h3>
		<p>
			The Release x86 configuration should be built first in a new environment as it
			is necessary to prebuild tools that are used in all configurations. After the build
			tools have been built once, any other configuration/platform can be built. This
			is necessary because the x64 build uses x86 tools to enable cross-compilation.
		</p>
		<h3>Build targets</h3>
		<p>
			There are end projects that can be built from the two solution files:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Altirra:</b> This is the main computer emulator.</li>
			<li><b>AltirraShell:</b> This is the device emulator.</li>
			<li><b>ATHelpFile:</b> Help file for the computer emulator.</li>
		</ul>
        <p>
            These projects have no direct dependency on each other, and the "run only startup"
            option in Visual Studio can be used to avoid having to build both Altirra and AltirraShell
            on every modification.
        </p>
		<p>
			For the emulators, three configurations are supported: Debug (unoptimized),
			Profile (optimized), and Release (LTCG). Debug is noticeably slower, but the
            performance difference between Profile and Release is minor.
		</p>
		<h3>Output locations and debugging setup</h3>
		<p>
			In general, compilation outputs go to the <tt>obj</tt> folder, library
			outputs to <tt>lib</tt>, and executables to <tt>out</tt>. A few files are also
			built into <tt>autogen</tt> folders within the projects. The end projects
			are set up to automatically default to the correct executable location to
			start debugging.
		</p>
		<h3>Possible failures</h3>
        <p>
            Link failures usually mean that an upstream project or file failed to build.
            Visual Studio has an unfortunate tendency to uselessly attempt linking a project
            whose dependencies have failed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If assembly language (<tt>.asm</tt>) files are failing to build, i.e. YASM
            returning a non-zero error code, this usually means that you don't have the
            path to YASM set up correctly.
        </p>
		<h3>Release script</h3>
		<p>
			For shipping builds, the release script (<tt>release.cmd</tt>) automates the process
			of generating and packaging a clean build. It is invoked in a Visual C++ build environment
			with the name of the version being released. The release script automatically
			injects the version string into the source tree, triggers a clean build, and then
			packages the result in the publish directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			The release script checks the version of <tt>cl.exe</tt> available in the PATH and
			will fail if it is not the expected version. Use <tt>/anyvc</tt> to bypass this check and
			force the current compiler to be used.
		</p>
		<p>
			The packaging step requires the Info-Zip archiver (<tt>zip.exe</tt>) and the repacking tool
            advancecomp (<tt>advzip.exe</tt>) to generate the final .zip files.
		</p>
        <h2>Deployment</h2>
		<h3>Licensing</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Please note that Altirra is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or above.
				All rebuilt versions of it must be distributed under compatible conditions.
			</b>
			The source code for the rebuilt version must be made available per the terms of the GPL for any released binaries.
			This is true even for pre-release versions.
		</p>
		<p>
			A few source code files have licenses that are more permissive than the GPL, and
			may be used as such on their own. This only applies to the files that have a block
			comment at the top describing the more permissive license option.
		</p>
		<h3>Third party content</h3>
		<p>
			The following third party content is present in Altirra with the following licences, believed to be GPL-compatible:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><tt>system\source\hash.cpp</tt>: MurmurHash3 (public domain; see source for reference)</li>
			<li><tt>Kasumi\data\Tuffy.ttf</tt>: Tuffy TrueType font (public domain; see Tuffy.txt for reference)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In addition, the built-in kernel contains a copy of the Atari system bitmap font. This is believed
			to not be copyrightable, but concerned parties should consult a qualified legal advisor for the
			pertinent jurisdictions as the author cannot provide legal assurance. No other parts of the Atari system ROMs are
			included or derived from in the included source.
		</p>
		<p>
			Altirra does not link with the Microsoft D3DX or D3DCompiler libraries. The latter is used in the build, but only
            the build tools link to D3DCompiler and the outputs are used without it.
		</p>
		<h3>Deployment dependencies</h3>
		<p>
			Altirra is statically linked against all necessary runtimes. In particular, neither the
			DirectX nor Visual C++ Redistributable are needed with the final executable regardless of
			OS.
