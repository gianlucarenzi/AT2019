Compile:
--------
make clean && make all MEMSIZEK=512

MEMSIZEK can be any size: 512, 1024, 2048, 4096

Launch: (Emulator)
-------
make build

If you want to test the software without memory expansion (just to see it
fails :-/ ) just add the DISABLE_EXPANSION=yes to makefile line.

e.g.: make clean && make all MEMSIZEK=1024 DISABLE_EXPANSION=yes

It needs cc65 compiler. I built from sources and installed in
PREFIX=$HOME. It works very good. The same for emulator atari800.
I used the gitub sources and build them too. It works great!
In my github branch I just wrote the MegaRam Driver for Emulator,
just to check if my hardware can be used in a real ATARI, before
launching the PCB production. ;-)

---------------------------------
Application Programming Interface
---------------------------------

To enable memory expansion write 1 at bank control register @ D531:

in C:
	unsigned char * bankctl = (unsigned char *) 0xd531;
	*(bankctl) = 1;

in ASM:
	lda #1
	sta $d531

To disable, simply write 0 at the same register.

To select the bank (window will be at 0x4000-0x7fff address) write the
correct bank number @ register bank select D530:

in C:
	unsigned char * banksel = (unsigned char *) 0xd530;
	unsigned char * ramwindow = (unsigned char *) 0x4000;

	*(bankctl) = 12;
	/* Write at the window of bank 13 */
	memcpy(ramwindow, data1, 0x4000); /* Max size will be 16K!!! */

	*(bankctl) = 7;
	/* Write at the window of bank 8 */
	memcpy(ramwindow, data2, 0x4000); /* Max size will be 16K!!! */
	...
	...

in ASM:
	; BANK 13
	lda #12
	sta $d530
;   Do some stuff at address $4000-$7fff
	...
	; BANK 8
	lda #7
	sta $d530
;   Do other stuff ad address $4000-$7fff
	...

Pretty simple... ;-P

We can have up to 256 memory banks available, so the register can have
a number between 0 (bank #0) up to 255 (bank #256).

In this way any other memory expansion can be used. In a plain 130XE computer
the total amount of memory will be 4096K + 128K - 16K (for the addresses
overlapped at the memory window): 4208k!!

Basic/ANTIC/... other stuff can be co-exists in this way.

Now, I can need some awesome software (MyDOS, SpartaDOS, demos, etc.,) which
this expansion can be used.

Enjoy!
