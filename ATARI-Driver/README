Compile:
--------
cl65 -t atari megaram.c -o megaram.sys

Launch: (Emulator)
-------
atari800 -win-width 800 -win-height 600 -xlxe_rom ~/ATARI/ATARIXL.ROM megaram.sys

It needs cc65 compiler. I built from sources and installed in PREFIX=$HOME. It works very good.
The same for emulator atari800. I used the gitub sources and build them too. It works great!

TODO:
MegaRam Driver for Emulator, just to check if my hardware can be used in a real ATARI, before launching
the PCB production. ;-)
