STm32-to-Amiga-Local-KeyBoard Adapter
=====================================

STM32 Usb Based firmware microcontroller for any Amiga internal keyboard adapter

This is a USB Keyboard controller, for reading and writing to Amiga internal bus KBD_DAT, KBD_CLOCK and KBD_RESET.

The firmware for this controller is based on the library of STM32

This hardware is designed to be compatible with the original host
hardware found on ANY Amiga personal computer (from Amiga 1000 to Amiga 4000),
internally (for Amiga 500, Amiga 600 and Amiga 1200) and externally (using some
simple keyboard adapters with Amiga 1000, Amiga 2000, Amiga 3000 and Amiga 4000)

Any Amiga Compatible Computer can use this adapter as well.
